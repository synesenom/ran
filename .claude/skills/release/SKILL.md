# Release Skill

You are cutting a versioned release of ranjs: bumping the version, updating
the changelog, creating and merging a release PR, and handing off to the
GitHub Actions release workflow which tags, publishes to npm, cuts the GitHub
release, and rotates the milestone.

This skill runs **entirely through GitHub MCP tools** — it needs neither the
`gh` CLI nor a local git tag push. Everything the skill cannot do from an
MCP-only environment (create the `v*` tag, `npm publish`, cut the GitHub
release, rotate the milestone) is done server-side by
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which the skill triggers via
`mcp__github__actions_run_trigger`. See
`decisions/0037-mcp-orchestrated-release.md`.

## Invocation

```
/release [version]
```

Optional `version` argument — the exact semver to release, e.g. `1.31.0`. If
omitted, the version is computed by bumping the minor part of the current
`package.json` version (`1.30.0` → `1.31.0`).

## Pre-conditions

- GitHub MCP tools available (`mcp__github__*`).
- `NPM_TOKEN` secret configured in repo Settings → Secrets → Actions (npm
  publish permission).
- `RELEASE_TOKEN` secret configured — a fine-grained PAT owned by a repo admin
  (repo: this one, Contents: read+write). `github-actions[bot]` cannot be added
  to the `v*` tag-protection ruleset's bypass list, so the workflow uses this
  PAT (which authenticates as an admin, who is in the bypass list) solely to
  push the release tag. One-time setup.
- `main` must be the default branch and there must be no in-flight release PR
  or existing `v{VERSION}` tag.

Throughout, use these MCP tools with `owner` = the repo owner and `repo` = the
repo name (derive from the remote, e.g. `synesenom`/`ran`).

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-flight

- `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` (state `open`) — abort if a
  `Release v*` PR is already open.
- `mcp__github__get_tag` for `v{VERSION}` once VERSION is known — abort if it
  already exists.
- `mcp__github__list_commits` on `main` — note the latest commit; the release
  PR bases off it.

Abort with a clear message if any check fails.

---

### 2. Determine version

Read the current version from `package.json` (via `mcp__github__get_file_contents`
on `main`, or the local checkout if present).

**If a `version` argument was provided**, use it as `VERSION`.

**Otherwise, default to a minor bump**: `X.Y.Z` → `X.(Y+1).0`.

Under the numpy/scipy-style versioning policy, **breaking changes ship in
minor releases** (behind a deprecation cycle), so a `breaking` label does
**not** trigger a major bump. A major bump (`X.Y.Z` → `(X+1).0.0`) is reserved
for a rare, sweeping overhaul and is only ever done by passing an explicit
`version` argument.

Optionally surface `breaking`-labelled issues closed since the last release via
`mcp__github__search_issues` so the operator is aware of behavior changes
(informational only — it does not change the bump type).

Compute `NEXT_VERSION` = `X.(Y+1).0` (the milestone the workflow will create).

Print `VERSION`, the bump type, any `breaking` issues, and `NEXT_VERSION`.

---

### 3. Show what's in the release

Use `mcp__github__list_commits` on `main` since the last release to display the
commit list. If it is empty, warn and ask the operator whether to continue.

---

### 4. Create release branch

`mcp__github__create_branch` — create `release/v{VERSION}` from `main`.

---

### 5. Update version files

On the `release/v{VERSION}` branch, edit and stage (do not commit yet — bundle
with step 6 into one commit):

- **`package.json`** — set `"version"` to `VERSION`.
- **`package-lock.json`** — set both the top-level `"version"` and the
  `packages[""].version` to `VERSION` (keep them in sync so `npm ci` on the
  runner does not fail).

---

### 6. Consolidate CHANGELOG

**This is the step that stays in the skill's judgement** — the workflow only
reads the finished section. Rewrite `CHANGELOG.md`:

1. Replace the `## [Unreleased]` heading with `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   (today's date) and prepend a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it.

2. **Order subsections** in the new `## [VERSION]` section to the canonical
   Keep-a-Changelog sequence: `Added` → `Changed` → `Deprecated` → `Removed`
   → `Fixed` → `Security`. Drop any subsection with no bullets. Merge any
   duplicate subsections (e.g. two `### Added` blocks) into one.

3. **Merge grouped bullets.** Collapse multiple bullets describing the same
   logical change applied to several items into a single bullet that names all
   items. One bullet per logical change, not per file.

4. **Keep every distinct change.** Prefer a slightly longer list over a lossy
   summary. **Do not touch** anything below the new versioned heading.

Verify the file parses correctly (no duplicate headings, no orphaned bullets).

---

### 7. Commit release branch

Commit the step 5 + step 6 edits as a single commit `Release v{VERSION}` on
`release/v{VERSION}` using `mcp__github__push_files` (all files in one commit).

---

### 8. Create PR

`mcp__github__create_pull_request`:
- title: `Release v{VERSION}`
- base: `main`, head: `release/v{VERSION}`
- body: the commit list from step 3 plus a note
  `*Automated release PR — do not add commits to this branch.*`

Record the PR number and URL.

---

### 9. Merge PR

Wait for the PR's required checks to pass, then merge:

- Poll `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (and `mcp__github__get_check_run` if
  needed) until the PR is mergeable and checks are green (5-minute timeout,
  ~15-second interval).
- `mcp__github__merge_pull_request` with method `merge`.

If the merge is blocked or times out, stop and report — do not force it.

---

### 10. Trigger the release workflow

Once the PR is merged (the bumped `package.json` and consolidated `CHANGELOG.md`
are now on `main`), trigger the workflow:

- `mcp__github__actions_run_trigger` — `workflow_id` `release.yml`, `ref`
  `main`, `inputs: { version: "VERSION" }`.

The workflow then, on the runner, does everything MCP cannot:

- creates and pushes the `v{VERSION}` tag,
- runs lint/typecheck/tests and `npm publish --provenance`,
- cuts the GitHub release with the consolidated `## [VERSION]` notes from
  `CHANGELOG.md`,
- rotates the milestone (creates `v{NEXT_VERSION}`, moves open issues, closes
  `v{VERSION}`).

Poll `mcp__github__actions_list` / `mcp__github__actions_get` for the run and
report its conclusion. If the run fails on the tag step, the most likely cause
is the `github-actions[bot]` tag-protection bypass not being configured (see
Pre-conditions).

---

### 11. Report

End with a concise summary:

```
Released:  v{VERSION}
PR:        {PR_URL} (merged)
Workflow:  {RUN_URL} → tag, npm publish, GitHub release, milestone rotation
Milestone: v{VERSION} closed, v{NEXT_VERSION} created (by the workflow)
```

## Rules

- **All GitHub state changes go through MCP** — never assume `gh` or a local
  tag push is available.
- **Never skip the workflow trigger** — without step 10 nothing is tagged or
  published to npm. The merged PR alone publishes nothing.
- **Consolidate the changelog in the skill, not the workflow** — the semantic
  merge of grouped bullets is judgement the workflow cannot do; it only reads
  the finished `## [VERSION]` section.
- **Milestone rotation is best-effort** — the workflow warns and continues if
  the milestone is missing.
- **No interactive prompts mid-pipeline** — if anything is ambiguous, abort
  early with a clear message rather than pausing mid-release.
