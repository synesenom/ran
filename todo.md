## Most Important

### Improve special function precision

The functions in `src/special/` are the numerical foundation for almost every distribution CDF, quantile, and likelihood. Known gaps:

- **`error.js` (erf/erfc)** — currently uses a series expansion that loses accuracy in the tail (|x| ≫ 1). Continued-fraction representations converge much faster in the tail and give near-machine-precision accuracy. See issue #211. This directly affects `Normal`, `LogNormal`, `Erfc`-based CDFs.
- **`gamma-incomplete.js`** — the regularized lower/upper incomplete gamma (P and Q) is used by Chi2, Gamma, Poisson CDF, and many others. Accuracy near `x=a` (where P≈Q≈0.5) and for large `a` is most critical; should be cross-validated against scipy/Boost.
- **`beta-incomplete.js`** — regularized incomplete beta `I_x(a,b)` underlies Beta, Binomial CDF, F, t. Known to lose digits when `x` is very close to 0 or 1 and `a,b` differ by orders of magnitude.
- **`bessel.js`** — large-order and large-argument Bessel functions (used by Rice, Noncentral distributions) rely on asymptotic expansions whose accuracy degrades near the transition region.
- **`digamma.js`** — used in Dirichlet-related computations; polygamma (derivatives beyond ψ₀) is not yet implemented.

**Goal:** every special function should be accurate to within a few ULP for all representable inputs, as documented in accuracy tables (see publication-grade section below).

---

## Publication-Grade Gaps

Moving the library from *auditable* to *publication-grade* requires systematic reference-value coverage and documented accuracy bounds.

### Filed as GitHub Issues

| # | Description |
|---|-------------|
| [#211](../../issues/211) | **erf/erfc precision** — replace the series expansion with a continued-fraction algorithm for |x| > ~3 to recover tail accuracy. |
| [#212](../../issues/212) | **Property tests** — automated checks that PDF ≥ 0, CDF is non-decreasing, and `quantile(cdf(x)) ≈ x` for all implemented distributions. |
| [#213](../../issues/213) | **quantile() reference values** — cross-validate `quantile()` against scipy's `ppf()` for the 12 core continuous distributions, at p = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999. |
| [#214](../../issues/214) | **Catastrophic cancellation audit** — find and fix `1 - exp(...)` and `1 - cdf(...)` patterns near boundaries that lose significant digits; replace with `expm1`/`log1p` equivalents or stable complementary forms. |
| [#135](../../issues/135) | **Second parameter set per distribution** — every distribution should have at least two independent `params` entries in `test/dist-cases-*.js`, each with its own reference values. |

### Not Yet Filed

- **Far-tail reference values for Normal/LogNormal** — add refVals at ±5σ and ±7σ to expose and track erf accuracy. Without these, regressions in tail precision are invisible.
- **Complete refVals for all ~120 remaining distributions** — currently only 12 continuous distributions have reference values in `test/dist-cases-continuous.js`. Every distribution needs PDF, CDF, and quantile checks at several points per parameter set.
- **RefVals and property tests for discrete distributions** — Binomial, Poisson, NegativeBinomial, and ~60 others lack systematic PMF/CDF reference values in `test/dist-cases-discrete.js`.
- **Full-domain special function validation** — cross-validate `gammaLowerIncomplete`, `betaIncomplete`, `bessel`, `digamma`, and others against scipy or Boost across their entire representable input domains, not just spot-check values.
- **Systematic parameter-space coverage** — for each distribution, construct a grid of parameter values (not just two hand-picked sets) to catch edge-case failure modes near parameter boundaries.
- **Documented accuracy bounds** — for each special function and distribution CDF, state clearly: "accurate to X ULP for |x| ≤ Y" so users can reason about numerical error in downstream computations.

### Continuous

#### Truncated Exponential
Exponential distribution restricted to the interval [a, b], 0 ≤ a < b ≤ ∞. Among the simplest missing distributions; follows the same pattern as the existing `TruncatedNormal`.
- **PDF:** f(x; λ, a, b) = λ·e^(−λx) / (e^(−λa) − e^(−λb))

#### Tweedie (Compound Poisson-Gamma)
Family parameterised by a power index p ∈ (1, 2): for fixed p the distribution is compound Poisson with Gamma-distributed cluster masses. Used in insurance loss models (exact-zero outcomes with a continuous positive tail), rainfall accumulation, and any GLM with a non-negative response. Special cases: p = 1 is Poisson, p = 2 is Gamma.
- **PMF/PDF:** no closed form; computed via a rapidly converging series over the compound Poisson terms
- **Sampling:** exact via compound structure — draw N ~ Poisson(λ), then sum N independent Gamma(α, β) variates
- **Dependency:** `_poisson.js`, `_gamma.js` (both already in `src/dist/`); `neumaier.js` for the series PDF
- Refs: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedie_distribution); Jørgensen (1987) *JRSS-B* 49(2):127–162

#### Stable (Lévy α-stable)
Four-parameter family (α ∈ (0,2], β ∈ [−1,1], γ ≥ 0, δ ∈ ℝ) encompassing all distributions that are limits of normalized sums of iid random variables. No closed-form PDF/CDF except for special cases (Cauchy: α=1, β=0; Gaussian: α=2; Lévy: α=½, β=1).
- **Sampling:** Chambers-Mallows-Stuck (CMS) algorithm — exact, O(1)
- **PDF/CDF:** numerical Fourier inversion; expensive and numerically delicate

- **CDF:** numerical integration only
- **Sampling:** inversion from tabulated quantiles or from the Moyal approximation
- Implementation note: the Moyal distribution (already in `src/dist/moyal.js`) is an analytically tractable approximation; exact Landau requires numerical Fourier inversion
- Refs: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau_distribution)

#### Crystal Ball
Continuous distribution with a Gaussian core above a threshold and a power-law tail below; used in particle physics for signal modelling.
- **PDF:** Gaussian for (x−μ)/σ > −α; power law C·(n/|α|·(n/|α|−|α|−(x−μ)/σ))^(−n) below

#### Double Exponential
**[duplicate]** — equivalent to the Laplace distribution; already implemented in `src/dist/laplace.js`.

#### Error / Exponential Power
**[duplicate]** — equivalent to the Generalized Normal (Subbotin) distribution; already implemented in `src/dist/generalized-normal.js`.

#### Davis
**[partial]** — `src/dist/davis.js` — PDF is correct but two blockers remain:
- `_generator()` returns a hardcoded `1` — needs actual implementation (rejection sampling with a bounding envelope over the power-law decay)
- `_cdf()` has a stray `console.log` and uses Romberg integration; numerical CDF is acceptable (no closed form exists) but the debug statement must be removed before the distribution is usable
- **refVals needed:** two parameter sets in `test/dist-cases-continuous.js` with PDF/CDF/quantile values cross-checked against scipy `davis` or manual integration
- Refs: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_distribution)

#### Champernowne
**[partial]** — `src/dist/champernowne.js` — Substantially incomplete:
- `_generator()` body is empty — no sampler at all
- `_pdf` is missing the normalization constant (`// TODO Add normalization factor`); the correct constant is C = α√(1−λ²)/π, derived from ∫ dx/(cosh(αx)+λ) = π/(α√(1−λ²))
- `_cdf()` is wrong — returns the hardcoded constant `this.c[0] = 1` instead of F(x) = ½ + (√(1−λ²)/π)·arctan(sinh(α(x−x₀))/√(1−λ²))
- **refVals needed:** two parameter sets in `test/dist-cases-continuous.js` with PDF/CDF/quantile values cross-checked against [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champernowne_distribution) or numerical integration

### Discrete

#### Discrete Laplace (Bilateral Geometric)

#### Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson)
The only distribution in the library that would cover *under-dispersion* (variance < mean). The Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Delaporte all cover over-dispersion; no existing discrete distribution handles count data with variance < mean, which arises in quality control, sports scoring, and retail transaction data.
- **PMF:** f(k; λ, ν) = λᵏ / ((k!)^ν · Z(λ, ν)) where Z = Σ λʲ/(j!)^ν

#### Panjer (a,b,0) Class
Unified actuarial recursion that subsumes Poisson, Binomial, and Negative Binomial via a single recurrence f(k) = (a + b/k)·f(k−1). Allows parameter sweeps across the entire class without selecting a named distribution; central to aggregate loss modelling in non-life insurance.

*Low-priority — specialist or narrow-domain distributions.*

#### Dirichlet-Multinomial (Pólya Distribution)
Marginal distribution of a Multinomial(n, p) when p is drawn from Dirichlet(α). The univariate marginal for a single component is the Beta-Binomial (already implemented); this is the multivariate generalisation. Central to topic modelling (LDA) and Bayesian A/B tests with more than two buckets.
- **PMF:** f(k; n, α) = C(n; k) · B(k+α) / B(α) where B is the multivariate beta function
- **Prerequisite:** The `Distribution` base class (`_pdf(x)`, `_cdf(x)`, `_generator()`) is scalar-valued. A **multivariate distribution base class** must be designed and filed as a separate architectural issue before this or any other vector-valued distribution (Dirichlet, Multivariate Normal, Wishart) can be added.
- Refs: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet-multinomial_distribution)

#### Beta-Geometric
**[partial]** — `src/dist/beta-geometric.js` — PMF and generator are present but carry a `// TODO Use log PDF` note. The current `_pk` computes `Math.exp(logBeta(…) − logBeta(…))` directly; for large k the difference of log-betas should be returned as-is (log-PMF) to avoid underflow, and the PreComputed base class updated to consume log probabilities.
- **refVals needed:** two parameter sets in `test/dist-cases-discrete.js` with PMF/CDF values cross-checked against [NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman2/auxillar/bgepdf.htm)

#### Beta-Negative Binomial
**[partial]** — `src/dist/beta-negative-binomial.js` — Three open issues:
1. Speed-up constants not computed (`// TODO Speed-up constants`)
2. The recurrence-based `_pk` has two commented-out alternative formulas alongside the active one, indicating the PMF is not yet finalised
3. The generator comment says `// TODO Direct sampling`; the current implementation compounds Beta → Gamma → Poisson which is correct but has higher variance than a direct method
- **refVals needed:** two parameter sets in `test/dist-cases-discrete.js` with PMF/CDF values cross-checked against [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_negative_binomial_distribution) or [NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman2/auxillar/bnbcdf.htm)

#### Yule-Simon
**[partial]** — `src/dist/yule-simon.js` — PMF and CDF formulas are correct. The generator uses an exponential-geometric compound representation which is mathematically sound, but the edge-case branch (`1 − z === 1 → Math.ceil(e1 / z)`) can produce `Infinity` when z underflows to exactly 0, since e1/0 = Infinity. That branch needs a large-sample approximation (e.g. return a Pareto-distributed integer) rather than the direct ratio.

## Statistical Tests

Currently in `src/test/`: `bartlett`, `levene`, `brown-forsythe`, `mann-whitney`, `hsic`.

### Normality Tests (category)
Several tests specifically target whether a sample comes from a normal distribution. Implement as a group since they share the framework of testing against a theoretical normal:

#### Shapiro-Wilk
Most powerful standard normality test for small samples (n ≤ ~50). Uses regression of order statistics on their expected values under normality.
- **Statistic:** W = (Σ aᵢ x_(i))² / Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² where aᵢ are precomputed coefficients
- **Dependency:** requires precomputed coefficient table (Royston 1992 approximation covers n up to ~5000)
- Complexity: moderate (table look-up dominates)

#### Anderson-Darling
EDF-based goodness-of-fit test; more sensitive than Kolmogorov-Smirnov in the tails. Can test against any continuous distribution, not just normality.
- **Statistic:** A² = −N − (1/N) Σ(2i−1)[ln z_(i) + ln(1 − z_(N+1−i))]  where z_(i) = F(x_(i))
- Critical values depend on the hypothesised distribution; for normality, Stephens (1974) tables
- Already partially covered by `ksTest` in `test/test-utils.js`; Anderson-Darling is stronger

#### Cramér-von Mises
EDF-based test, less sensitive at tails than Anderson-Darling but has a simpler asymptotic distribution.
- **Statistic:** W² = Σ(z_(i) − (2i−1)/(2N))² + 1/(12N)
- Asymptotic distribution is tabulated; exact distribution computable via eigenvalue method

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
One-way F-test for equality of means across k ≥ 2 independent groups. Assumes normality and homoscedasticity (use Welch's or Kruskal-Wallis as alternatives).
- **Statistic:** F = (SSB / (k−1)) / (SSW / (N−k))  where SSB = between-group SS, SSW = within-group SS
- **Dependency:** F distribution (already in `src/dist/f.js`)

### Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM)
Non-parametric test for differences between groups based on a pairwise dissimilarity matrix. Analogous to MANOVA but distribution-free.
- **Statistic:** R = (r̄_B − r̄_W) / (N(N−1)/4)  where r̄_B and r̄_W are mean ranks of between- and within-group dissimilarities
- R ∈ [−1, 1]; R ≈ 1 implies groups are well separated
- Significance via permutation testing

### Breusch-Pagan
Test for heteroscedasticity in a linear regression. Regresses squared residuals on the predictors; a large R² indicates variance is not constant.
- **Statistic:** LM = n · R²_{auxiliary} ~ χ²(k) under H₀
- **Dependency:** Chi2 distribution (already in `src/dist/chi2.js`)

### Welch's t-test
Two-sample t-test for equality of means when variances are unequal (does not assume homoscedasticity). Preferred over Student's t-test in practice.
- **Degrees of freedom:** Welch-Satterthwaite approximation: ν = (s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂)² / ((s₁²/n₁)²/(n₁−1) + (s₂²/n₂)²/(n₂−1))
- **Dependency:** Student-t distribution (already in `src/dist/student-t.js`)

### Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
Non-parametric test for the median of a single sample (or paired differences). Alternative to one-sample t-test.
- **Statistic:** W = Σ sgn(xᵢ − μ₀) · Rᵢ  where Rᵢ = rank of |xᵢ − μ₀|
- Normal approximation for n > 25; exact distribution via recursion for small n

### Wald Test
General-purpose test of parametric hypotheses H₀: Rθ = r. Asymptotically chi-squared.
- **Statistic:** W = (Rθ̂ − r)ᵀ [R · Var(θ̂) · Rᵀ]⁻¹ (Rθ̂ − r) ~ χ²(rank(R))
- Requires user to supply the estimate θ̂ and its covariance matrix; a general framework rather than a specific test

## Time Series (`src/ts/`)

Currently only `online-covariance.js` is implemented.

### General Aggregator Class
An online (streaming) aggregator that maintains running statistics in O(1) time and O(1) space per update. Should expose at minimum:
- `count`, `mean`, `variance`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `sum`
- Welford's algorithm for numerically stable running variance
- Optional: quantile tracking via P² or t-digest

---

## Stochastic Processes (`src/process/` — not yet started)

A new module for discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes. Each process object should implement a standard interface:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `next()` | Advance one step; return the new state |
| `trend()` | Extract the deterministic drift component |
| `noise()` | Extract the stochastic (noise) component |
| `mean(power)` | Compute the p-th power mean of the trajectory |
| `correlation(lag)` | Autocovariance / autocorrelation at given lag |

### Brownian Motion / Standard Wiener Process
The foundational continuous-time process: W(t) − W(s) ~ Normal(0, t − s) for s < t, independent increments.
- **Discrete simulation:** Wₙ = Wₙ₋₁ + √(Δt) · Z,  Z ~ Normal(0,1)
- Serves as the building block for all Itô diffusions below

### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process
Mean-reverting diffusion: dX = θ(μ − X)dt + σ dW.
- **Exact discrete update:** Xₙ₊₁ = Xₙ · e^(−θΔt) + μ(1 − e^(−θΔt)) + σ√((1−e^(−2θΔt))/(2θ)) · Z
- Used in finance (Vasicek interest rate model), physics (Langevin equation)
- **Dependency:** none beyond core PRNG

### Gaussian Process
A distribution over functions; fully specified by a mean function m(t) and a covariance (kernel) function k(t, t′).
- **Simulation:** Cholesky decomposition of the N×N covariance matrix, then multiply by a standard normal vector
- Common kernels: squared-exponential (RBF), Matérn, periodic
- **Dependency:** `src/la/matrix.js` (Cholesky)
- Note: O(N³) simulation cost; for large N, sparse or approximation methods needed

### Galton-Watson Branching Process
Discrete-time process: Xₙ₊₁ = Σᵢ₌₁^Xₙ Zᵢ where Zᵢ are iid offspring counts drawn from an offspring distribution.
- **Parameters:** offspring distribution (any distribution in `src/dist/` works; Poisson and Geometric are standard)
- **Key quantities:** extinction probability, expected population size, variance
- **Simulation:** straightforward per-generation loop

---

## MCMC (`src/mc/`)

Currently implemented: `RWM` (random walk Metropolis), `SliceSampler`, `MCMC2`, `GelmanRubin`.

### Gibbs Sampling
Component-wise sampler: at each step, draw each coordinate xᵢ from its full conditional p(xᵢ | x₋ᵢ). Mixes well in low dimensions when conditionals are tractable.
- **Interface:** user supplies an array of conditional samplers `[p(x₁|…), p(x₂|…), …]`
- No acceptance step; always accepted
- Can be combined with Metropolis steps for intractable conditionals (Metropolis-within-Gibbs)

### Adaptive Metropolis (AM)
Standard RWM with a covariance-adapting proposal: Σ_proposal = (2.38²/d) · Cov(x₁,…,xₙ) + ε·I (Haario-Saksman-Tamminen 2001).
- **Adaptation:** update the empirical covariance during burn-in; freeze after
- **Dependency:** `src/la/matrix.js` (Cholesky for sampling from multivariate normal)
- Note: Ergodicity requires careful scheduling of adaptation; stop adapting after a fixed number of steps

### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
Uses gradient information to propose distant moves along Hamiltonian trajectories, dramatically reducing random-walk behaviour.
- **Algorithm:** leapfrog integrator for L steps of size ε, Metropolis accept/reject
- **User supplies:** log-posterior and its gradient (∂log p(θ)/∂θ)
- **Tuning:** step size ε and path length L are critical; NUTS automates this
- Ref: Neal (2011) "MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics" in *Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo*

### NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler)
Extension of HMC that automatically tunes the trajectory length by building a binary tree until a U-turn criterion is met, eliminating the need to set L manually.
- **Algorithm:** recursive doubling of leapfrog steps; slice sampling selects the transition
- **Dual averaging:** adapts step size ε during warm-up (Hoffman-Gelman 2014)
- **Dependency:** HMC leapfrog integrator (implement HMC first)
- This is the sampler used by Stan, PyMC, and NumPyro

### Rejection Sampling for Log-Concave Distributions
Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS, Gilks-Wild 1992): for log-concave densities, automatically constructs a piecewise-exponential envelope from evaluation points and tightens it adaptively.
- Avoids the need for the user to specify a bounding constant
- **Dependency:** log-concavity check or trust; works best for unimodal, differentiable log-densities

### Euclidean Metric Adaptation
In HMC/NUTS, preconditioning by an estimated mass matrix M (the inverse of the parameter covariance) improves mixing by removing scale differences between dimensions.
- **Warm-up phase:** accumulate sample covariance; set M = Cov(θ)⁻¹
- **Dependency:** `src/la/matrix.js` (inversion or Cholesky)

### Step Size Jittering
Randomly perturb the leapfrog step size ε each iteration (e.g. ε ~ Uniform(0.9ε₀, 1.1ε₀)) to break periodicity artifacts in HMC trajectories.

Functions needed for the distributions above or otherwise missing:

| Function | Needed by | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **`besselK` — K_ν(x), all real ν** | NIG, Variance-Gamma, Normal Product, Generalized Hyperbolic, Maxwell-Jüttner | **Entirely absent.** `src/special/bessel.js` exports only first-kind functions (I_ν). K_ν must be added as a standalone prerequisite issue before any of the listed distributions can be implemented. Recurrence: K_{n+1}(x) = (2n/x)·K_n(x) + K_{n−1}(x); seed from K_0 and K_1 series. |
| Polygamma ψₙ(x), n ≥ 1 | Various | Trigamma (n=1) most urgent; can derive from digamma recurrence + Euler-Maclaurin |
| Exponential integral Eₙ(x), Ei(x) | Planck CDF | Related to incomplete gamma; Ei(x) = −E₁(−x) for x > 0 |
| Polylogarithm Liₛ(z) | Planck CDF, Fermi-Dirac | Li₂ (dilogarithm) has known series; general Liₛ needs Lerch transcendent |
| Elliptic integrals K(k), E(k) | Some special distributions | Carlson symmetric forms most numerically stable |
| `log1p(x)`, `expm1(x)` | Catastrophic cancellation (#214) | Use `Math.log1p` / `Math.expm1` (native in JS); ensure they are used consistently |
